    string str=" The expectations for documenting the rationale and methodology behind valuation adjustments for less liquid positions are detailed and rigorous. Authorised Persons are required to establish and maintain procedures for judging the necessity of and calculating adjustments to the current valuation of less liquid positions for regulatory capital purposes. These adjustments should reflect the illiquidity of the positions and may exceed those made under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and other guidance notes.\n\n### Key Expectations:\n\n1. **Establishment and Maintenance of Procedures**:\n   - Authorised Persons must create and uphold procedures for determining and calculating adjustments to the valuation of less liquid positions (DocumentID: 13, PassageID: APP2.A2.5.Guidance.10).\n\n2. **Consideration of Illiquidity**:\n   - The adjustment should be designed to reflect the illiquidity of the position, whether the position is marked to market using market prices, observable inputs, third-party valuations, or marked to model (DocumentID: 13, PassageID: APP2.A2.5.Guidance.10).\n\n3. **Relevant Factors for Adjustment**:\n   - Authorised Persons should consider various factors when determining the appropriateness of the adjustment, including time to hedge, bid/offer spreads, market quotes, trading volumes, market concentrations, aging of positions, reliance on marking to model, and model risks (DocumentID: 13, PassageID: APP2.A2.5.Guidance.12).\n\n4. **Ongoing Review**:\n   - Adjustments should be reviewed continuously for their continued appropriateness, especially considering market events that may reduce liquidity (DocumentID: 13, PassageID: APP2.A2.5.Guidance.11).\n\n5. **Model Risk Assessment**:\n   - For complex products, Authorised Persons should explicitly assess the need for valuation adjustments to reflect model risk, including the risk associated with using an incorrect valuation methodology and unobservable calibration parameters (DocumentID: 13, PassageID: APP2.A2.5.Guidance.13).\n\n6. **Formal Consideration of Valuation Adjustments**:\n   - The Regulator expects formal consideration of various valuation adjustments, such as unearned credit spreads, close-out costs, operational risks, early termination, investing and funding costs, future administrative costs, and model risk (DocumentID: 13, PassageID: APP2.A2.5.Guidance.9).\n\n### Additional Notes:\n\n- **Regulator's Assessment**: The Regulator will evaluate an Authorised Person's valuation procedures for consistency with the guidance and may impose a valuation adjustment if there is a material inconsistency (DocumentID: 13, PassageID: 2.4.Guidance.4.).\n- **Documentation of Stress Testing**: Recognised Clearing Houses must record the results of stress testing and the rationale for any adjustments made to liquid resources (DocumentID: 10, PassageID: 4.7.34).\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nAuthorised Persons are expected to document the rationale and methodology behind valuation adjustments for less liquid positions comprehensively. This includes establishing procedures, considering various factors, conducting ongoing reviews, and formally assessing necessary adjustments. The Regulator will scrutinize these procedures for compliance and may impose additional adjustments if inconsistencies are found.";
